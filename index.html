                <h2>Preface</h2>
                <p>In the fast-paced world of surgery, every decision that a surgeon makes carries significant weight, which ultimately makes the patient’s world hang in balance between life and death.<br><br>
                    But what if there was a way to transform this chaotic environment into one of clarity and precision?
                    What if there was a tool that could help surgeons make better, more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes? <br><br>
                    That's where our project, DataSurg, comes in.<br><br>
                    Therefore, to make our aspirations successful and bring it onto the main stage, we’ve compiled and analyzed data from a leading hospital system in South Korea.
                    Through our innovative interactive data visualizations, we’ve created a way to turn complex surgical data into something more accessible and actionable.
                    This dataset ultimately is the bridge between a happy family and improved healthcare around the world, providing a comprehensive look at surgical outcomes.
                    Featuring a range of visualizations designed to uncover critical patterns and relationships, these insights can help optimize surgical decision-making, personalize patient care, and enhance hospital efficiency.</p>

                <h2>Interactive Visualizations</h2>
                <p>Below is the scatterplot showing the relationship between patient age and surgery duration, with color representing the surgery approach.<br><br>
                    Use the dropdown to filter by sex.</p>

                <h3>BMI, ICU Stay, and Mortality Rates</h3>
                <p>Explore this multi-bar graph to analyze how BMI categories relate to ICU stay length and mortality/survival rates.<br><br>
                    Hover over the respective bars for detailed insights, such as survivors and deceased counts, mortality rate percentage, and many more summary statistics about the hospital data.<br><br>
                    Toggle between deceased and surviving patients in the bottom-right-hand corner to see the bars update dynamically, with the blue bar showing average ICU stay days and the red bar showing the mortality rate in percentage for those patients.</p>

                <h3>Risk Factor Analysis</h3>
                <p>This heatmap, constructed with a 2x2 matrix-type design, shows the correlation between patient risk factors and clinical outcomes.<br><br>
                    The diverging purple-green color scale shows a stronger correlation associated with a darker color.<br><br>
                    Hover over each cell to identify a specific relationship between patient characteristics and their respective clinical outcomes, its respective Pearson's r correlation value, and a brief description of the strength of the two variables being measured.<br><br>
                    Click to see the cell dynamically update the gradient with more depth, as well as shadowing the other cells to divert focus from them.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion/Takeaways</h2>
                <p>The key takeaway? Data-driven insights have the power to revolutionize surgical decision-making, ultimately improving patient outcomes and enhancing healthcare efficiency.
                By transforming complex surgical data into intuitive and interactive visualizations, we hold the keys to empowering both surgeons and patients to make informed choices that can directly impact patients and their personal as well as professional lives.<br><br>
                    The caveat, however?<br><br>
                    While our work lays the groundwork for AI-driven advancements in healthcare, some challenges such as data privacy and real-time integration still exist.
                    That's why to unlock the full potential of surgical data, continued innovation and collaboration will be essential.
                    More people will have to contribute in an open-source fashion, prospering and driving progress in the world of healthcare.</p>
