1. Trends in ICU Stay & Outcomes By BMI (Multi-Bar Chart) - Mehul

Columns to use:
icu_days (number of days spent in ICU)
death_inhosp (death during hospitalization, binary)
bmi (to filter or color by BMI groups)

Axes:
The x-axis is bmi (binned into groups such as Underweight, Overweight, Obese, Normal).
The y-axis is icu_days (average ICU stay in that time period).
A second y-axis overlays mortality rate trends in percentage, adding more insight to deceased
and surviving patients in the ICU.

Interaction:
Users can toggle between patients who survived and who died.
Hover tooltips for detailed insights, such as survivors and deceased counts, mortality rate percentage, and 
many more summary statistics about the hospital data.

Purpose:
This plot helps visualize whether BMI plays a role in ICU stays increasing or decreasing over time.
It may also reveal whether higher BMI correlates with longer ICU stays or higher mortality rates.

2. Risk Factors Heatmap -- Mehul

Columns to use:
age
bmi
preop_htn (preoperative hypertension, binary)
preop_dm (diabetes, binary)
asa
icu_days or death_inhosp as the outcome.

Plot Details:
A heatmap where:
X-axis is risk factors (preop_htn, preop_dm, bmi, age, asa).
Y-axis is outcome categories (icu_days bins or death_inhosp).
Color intensity represents correlation strength.

Interaction:
Hovering over a cell shows exact correlation values.
Clicking on a factor filters other charts to show affected patient groups.

Purpose:
This would highlight the biggest risk factors for ICU stay or death.
If a particular factor (e.g., ASA score) has a high correlation with mortality, it may be an important consideration for surgeons.

3. Predicting Surgery Outcomes (Sankey Diagram) -- Jeronimo

Columns to use:
asa (ASA physical status classification)
optype (surgery type)
icu_days (grouped into bins: 0 days, 1-3 days, 4+ days)
death_inhosp
Plot Details:

A Sankey diagram where:
The first node is asa (e.g., healthy vs. pre-existing conditions).
The second node is optype (surgery type).
The third node is ICU stay duration.
The final node is survival vs. death.

Interaction:
Hovering over a flow path highlights that patient group.
Clicking filters other charts to show details of that subgroup.

Purpose:
This visualization would reveal how ASA classification influences ICU stay and mortality.
For example, you may find that high ASA scores have a much higher chance of ICU stays and mortality.

4. Scatterplot of Surgery Duration vs. Patient Age, Colored by Surgery Type (By Sex) -- Ansh (& Write-up)

Columns
X-axis: Patient age (age)
Y-axis: Surgery duration (opend - opstart)
Color: Surgery approach (approach, e.g., Open, Videoscopic, etc.)
Size (optional): BMI (bmi) â€“ larger dots for higher BMI
Dropdown filter: Select sex (sex column, M or F)

A scatterplot where:
The relationship is clear between patient age and surgery duration, 
categorized by surgery type, with an interactive dropdown to filter by sex.

Interaction:
Dropdown filter: Users can pick Male (M) or Female (F), and the scatter plot updates accordingly.
Tooltip on hover: Show details like exact age, surgery type, and duration.
Legend for surgery type: Each type (Open, Videoscopic, etc.) will have a distinct color.

Purpose:
To answer the questions of: Does surgery duration differ significantly between males and females?
re videoscopic surgeries quicker than open surgeries? Do older patients undergo more invasive procedures?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Interactive Bar Chart Showing Trends by Department -- Jeronimo

Columns:

X-axis: Surgery types or disease types (optype or diagnosis).
Y-axis: Count of surgeries performed in that department.
Dropdown menu: Allows the user to select a department.
Interaction: The bar chart updates dynamically when a new department is selected.
