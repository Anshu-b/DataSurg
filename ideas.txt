Plot ideas: 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Trends in ICU Stay & Outcomes (Time-Series Chart)

Columns to use:
casestart (time when case started)
icu_days (number of days spent in ICU)
death_inhosp (death during hospitalization, binary)
bmi (to filter or color by BMI groups)

Axes:
The x-axis is casestart (binned into weeks/months).
The y-axis is icu_days (average ICU stay in that time period).
A second line overlays mortality rate over time.

Interaction:
Users can filter by BMI groups to see if obesity impacts ICU stays.
Hovering over points shows specific case details.

Purpose:
This plot helps visualize whether ICU stays are increasing or decreasing over time.
It may also reveal whether higher BMI correlates with longer ICU stays or higher mortality rates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Risk Factors Heatmap

Columns to use:
age
bmi
preop_htn (preoperative hypertension, binary)
preop_dm (diabetes, binary)
asa
icu_days or death_inhosp as the outcome.
Plot Details:

A heatmap where:
X-axis is risk factors (preop_htn, preop_dm, bmi, age, asa).
Y-axis is outcome categories (icu_days bins or death_inhosp).
Color intensity represents correlation strength.

Interaction:
Hovering over a cell shows exact correlation values.
Clicking on a factor filters other charts to show affected patient groups.

Purpose:
This would highlight the biggest risk factors for ICU stay or death.
If a particular factor (e.g., ASA score) has a high correlation with mortality, it may be an important consideration for surgeons.

3. Predicting Surgery Outcomes (Sankey Diagram)

Columns to use:
asa (ASA physical status classification)
optype (surgery type)
icu_days (grouped into bins: 0 days, 1-3 days, 4+ days)
death_inhosp
Plot Details:

A Sankey diagram where:
The first node is asa (e.g., healthy vs. pre-existing conditions).
The second node is optype (surgery type).
The third node is ICU stay duration.
The final node is survival vs. death.

Interaction:
Hovering over a flow path highlights that patient group.
Clicking filters other charts to show details of that subgroup.

Purpose:
This visualization would reveal how ASA classification influences ICU stay and mortality.
For example, you may find that high ASA scores have a much higher chance of ICU stays and mortality.

4. Scatterplot of Surgery Duration vs. Patient Age, Colored by Surgery Type (By Sex)

Columns
X-axis: Patient age (age)
Y-axis: Surgery duration (opend - opstart)
Color: Surgery approach (approach, e.g., Open, Videoscopic, etc.)
Size (optional): BMI (bmi) â€“ larger dots for higher BMI
Dropdown filter: Select sex (sex column, M or F)

A scatterplot where:
The relationship is clear between patient age and surgery duration, 
categorized by surgery type, with an interactive dropdown to filter by sex.

Interaction:
Dropdown filter: Users can pick Male (M) or Female (F), and the scatter plot updates accordingly.
Tooltip on hover: Show details like exact age, surgery type, and duration.
Legend for surgery type: Each type (Open, Videoscopic, etc.) will have a distinct color.

Purpose:
To answer the questions of: Does surgery duration differ significantly between males and females?
re videoscopic surgeries quicker than open surgeries? Do older patients undergo more invasive procedures?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Interactive Bar Chart Showing Trends by Department -- Ansh (& Write-up)

Columns:

X-axis: Surgery types or disease types (optype or diagnosis).
Y-axis: Count of surgeries performed in that department.
Dropdown menu: Allows the user to select a department.
Interaction: The bar chart updates dynamically when a new department is selected.
