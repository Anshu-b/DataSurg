### What Have We Done So Far?
Unlike Project 3 where it felt like we were playing catch-up, we decided to start early and confront the shortcomings we felt from Project 3. So far, we have designed and implemented 5 rough interactive visualizations using D3.js to analyze trends in surgical data. We created a **scatterplot** to examine the relationship between surgery duration and patient age, categorized by surgery approach and filtered by sex, with the ability to filter making the plot interactive. Furthermore, there is a tooltip similar to what we implemented in the labs to get more information about a particular point, and also since our dataset is massive we created a "resample" button to display a subset of 75 randomly sampled patients. We also developed a **multi-bar chart** to explore how BMI affects ICU stays and mortality rates, providing a toggle feature to differentiate between surviving and deceased patients. A **heatmap** was implemented to analyze correlations between preoperative risk factors and clinical outcomes, using an interactive color gradient to highlight significant relationships. Furthermore, a **Sankey diagram** was designed to predict surgery outcomes by tracing the flow from ASA classification to surgery type, ICU stay, and survival. Lastly, an **interactive bar chart** was added to visualize surgical trends by department, allowing users to filter data dynamically. These visualizations were integrated into a cohesive web page with explanatory text, interactive elements, and tooltips to enhance user engagement.
While these graphs are mostly implemented, there is still some work to do in terms of making them more interactive and improved from a design-elements perspective.

### What Will Be the Most Challenging Aspect of Your Project to Design and Why?
One of the most challenging aspects of our project has been the impressive Sankey chart, since we had to read a lot of extra documentation to figure that out. Furthermore, ensuring smooth **interactivity and usability** across all five visualizations will be an issue. Each chart requires different interaction techniques, such as dropdown filters, hover effects, tooltips, and dynamic updates, which must be carefully put togethere. Additionally, **data preprocessing** was and will be a critical challenge, since a lot of this data is medical-related and requires extensive domain knowledge that we will have to learn and be able to explain. Given the large dataset, filtering and updating visualizations efficiently without causing lag will require strategic data handling, particularly for the scatterplot and Sankey diagram, which involve numerous data points. Lastly, integrating all the visualizations to tell a data story on the webpage will be crucial.
